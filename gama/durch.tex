\subsection{Calibration of the Instruments and the NaJ-Scintillator}
Our tutor instructed us how to use the instruments of the lab. During the experiment we worked with a Scintillation-counter, an Amplifier, an Oscilloscope and a Computer with a Software called 'Cassy Lab'. At the beginning we had to calibrate the instruments with the radioactive nuclides of $^{60}$Co, $^{137}$Cs and $^{22}$Na. After adjusting the settings of the Oscilloscope and the Amplifier, we took the $^{60}$Co sample in front of the NaJ-Detector, and plotted the spectrum of the sample with the software. We repeated this step with the other two samples. Each of the samples were detected for three minutes so the software generates a plot where we could see the different peaks of the samples (for a closer look on our results, see the following images).

The following picture is an illustration of a closer look at the photopeak of $^{60}$Co with the Gauschen fit.

After fitting the photopeaks of $^{60}$Co (has 2 ones), $^{137}$Cs and $^{22}$Na we plot the result in the following tabular and picture to illustrate the calibration of the NaJ-Scintillator-Detector.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Channel & Energy & $\sigma$\\
\hline
(5379.24$\pm$1.85)& 1173.238 & 214.19\\
(6094.94$\pm$1.80) & 1332.513 &  193.32\\	
(3057.29$\pm$0.37) & 661.661 & 125.44\\
(5642.27$\pm$5.66) & 1274.545 & 197.15\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\myImage[8cm]{img/cal}{Results of the calibration of the NaJ-Scintillator}

Using these values we get an energy-resolution by using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
FWHM = 2\cdot \sqrt{2 ln 2} \cdot \sigma \cdot m
\end{equation}

Our $\sigma$ of $^{60}$Co is 193.32 and m = 0.225 so we get an resolution of 67.3 keV. We need the m-factor in this equation in order to get FWHM in keV

\subsection{Absorptions coefficient of different materials}
To determine the absorption coefficient of different materials, we took a different number of plates of different materials. These materials had been Aluminium, Lead and Copper. The plates had have a thickness between 2 and 3 mm so in the first place we tokk a measurement without a plate to calibrate. After finishing this step, we proceeded with one plate until we had seven of them. We started with the Copper plates, then we measured the absorption of Aluminium and finished with lead.
In the following diagramms it is shown, how absorption is dependent of the material and its thickness.\\

\myImage[8cm]{img/al}{Result of our measurement for aborptions coefficient of Al}

The aborptions coefficient of Aluminium is:
\begin{center}
$\mu_{Al} = (0.0293 \pm 0.0039)\frac{1}{mm}$
\end{center}

\myImage[8cm]{img/cu}{Result of our measurement for aborptions coefficient of Cu}

So the aborptions coefficient of Copper is:
\begin{center}
$\mu_{Cu} = (0.0568 \pm 0.0083)\frac{1}{mm}$
\end{center}

\myImage[8cm]{img/pb}{Result of our measurement for aborptions coefficient of Pb}

And at least the aborptions coefficient of lead is:
\begin{center}
$\mu_{Pb} = (0.0698 \pm 0.0077)\frac{1}{mm}$
\end{center}

The values for $m$ are the activity at the beginning. $O$ represent the offset. As expected, the higher the atomic number of the material the higher is its aborptions coefficient.

\subsection{1 Hour measurement of $^{60}$Co}
Before measureing $^{60}$Co for one houre, we had to switch some cables and turn the Ge-Detector on. To calibrate the Ge-detector we took again $^{60}$Co, $^{137}$Cs,$^{22}$Na and $^{241}$Am. We measured each of those elements for three minutes. The results of these measurements will help us to identify the peaks of the $^{60}$Co-diagramm. The following graphic represents our calibration-curve for the Ge-Detector.

Then we took the probe and measured the radiation for one hour. Our result is shown in the following graphic.

The following tabular represents our results of the different peaks and their energy.

\end{tabular}

\subsection{Measurement of X-Ray conversion-lines}
For this experiment we took $^{133}$Ba and calibrated the Ge-Detector by measuring the probe for three minutes. Then we took four filters made of different materials. These materials were Tin (Sn), Antimon (Sb),  Tellurium (Tn) and Iodine (I).

\section{Discussion}
After calibrating the NaJ-Szintillator successfully we had taken our results. The ones of the first part seems to be realistic to us. Our results were:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
Channel & Energy & $\sigma$\\
\hline
(5379.24$\pm$1.85)& 1173.238 & 214.19\\
(6094.94$\pm$1.80) & 1332.513 &  193.32\\	
(3057.29$\pm$0.37) & 661.661 & 125.44\\
(5642.27$\pm$5.66) & 1274.545 & 197.15\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Plotting these values gives us a slope of m = 0.225 due to this we got a resolution of 67.3 keV for the NaJ-Szintillator.\\
\\
Our results for the absorptions coefficient are:\\
\begin{center}
$\mu_{Al} = (0.0293 \pm 0.0039)\frac{1}{mm}$\\
$\mu_{Cu} = (0.0568 \pm 0.0083)\frac{1}{mm}$\\
$\mu_{Pb} = (0.0698 \pm 0.0077)\frac{1}{mm}$\\
\end{center}

So it's clear that lead has the highest absorption of these three materials. These results seem realistic to us too.\\
\\
Investigating the plot of the measurement of $^{60}$Co leads us to the result that our experimental values for the energy are almost the literaric ones. Investigating the compton-edges was difficult because it makes a difference whether we take the enery of the beginning or the energy of the end of the edge. Due to this fact we decided to take a bigger error for the edges.
